### Data
NAs in bio14 2011-2040 layer?
Crop with sf in box mode?

### Absence generation
How many absences? Prevalence?

### Variable selection 
Check all possible variable combinations for smallest VIFs?
Compare with AIC?
Use all years for selection?
Use all lccs_classes for relative in lc?
Only use comp1, since 84% of variance?
Use absence points in pca?
Include all quadratic versions as options in selection? (so lc too)
### Model building
Use family binomial?
Problem fitting "categorical" data with regression models?
Model predicts suitability higher than 1?
Absences in testing not misleading since generated? Boyce index?
Give maxent different background?
Which threshold method to use? (very low suitability, methods don't work?)
Very bad model performance (TSS ensemble wrong?)

### Writing
Where to put reference when quoting.
Can use pictures from papers with citation?
