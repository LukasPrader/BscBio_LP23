# Overview: This repository holds the code and files for my bachelor thesis
# written in the summer of SS23 under supervision of Matthew Talluto.

# !!important!!
# All files can not be run from the repository itself, since the data required
# is quite large. All files numerated with 0.x run with raw downloaded files 
# from the Gbif, CHELSA* or Copernicus database and require very large amounts of
# disk space (300-400 GB), everything after can be run with a more manageable 
# amount (50 GB max, not sure yet).
# *the file 'envidats3paths.txt 

# The code has mainly been written and executed using the IDE VSCode in a WSL
# environment. In general everything should be executable in RStudio, if the
# file paths are corrected to normal windows paths.
