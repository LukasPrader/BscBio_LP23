# Overview: 
This repository holds the code and files for my bachelor thesis
written in the summer of SS23 under supervision of Matthew Talluto.

The code can not be run from the repository itself, since the data required
is quite large. All files numerated with 0.x run with raw downloaded files 
from the Gbif, CHELSA or Copernicus database and require rather large amounts 
of disk space (75 GB). In total, all generated files take up X GB of space.
The file 'envidats3paths.txt' holds all links to download the CHELSA bioclim
layers with wget, Gbif and Copernicus data was downloaded with a web browser. 

The code has mainly been written and executed using the IDE VSCode in a WSL
environment. 
In general, everything should also be executable in RStudio.
