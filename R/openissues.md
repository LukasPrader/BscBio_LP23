### Data
NAs in bio14 2011-2040 layer?
Crop with sf in box mode?

### Absence generation
How many absences? Prevalence?

### Variable selection 
Check all possible variable combinations for smallest VIFs?
Compare with AIC?
Use all years for selection?
Use all lccs_classes as binary in pca?
Use absence points in pca?
Include quadratic versions as options in selection? (maxent includes them again after)

### Model building
Use family binomial?
Problem fitting "categorical" data with linear models?
Model predicts suitability higher than 1?
Absences in testing not misleading since generated?
Give maxent different background?
Which threshold method to use? (very low suitability, methods don't work?)
